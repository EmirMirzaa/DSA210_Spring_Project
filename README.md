# DSA210_Project_Uber

## Proposal

### Project Motivation
This project focuses on analyzing my own uber trip data to uncover patterns and insights about travel length, pricing, and ride density. Gaining knowledge of these elements can help us understand ride-sharing trends and user behavior. Additionally, enhancing my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning is possible with this project. 

### Data Source
In this project, the dataset is going to used was obtained directly from Uber's platform. I formally requested access through their website, and they provided detailed trip data. This raw data includes fields such as:

1. Trip Details:
   - Trip request, start, and end times.
   - Trip distance and fare amount.
   - Driver response time.

2. App Usage Information
   - Event timestamps and session details.

### Research Questions
The following important questions will be addressed by the project:
1. How does the time of day affect travel duration for trips of the same distance?
2. How does the time of a ride request impact the time taken to find a driver?
3. What is the relationship between trip distance and cost?
4. Do prices increase at certain hours or days?
5. During which hours and days are trips most frequent?
6. Can we predict travel duration or cost based on trip details?

### Plan
Data Cleaning: 
Handling missing values and inconsistencies, and converting time fields into proper formats for analysis on the raw data.

Exploratory Data Analysis: 
Analyzing trends in travel duration across different times of the day. 
Investigating pricing patterns across various distances and times. 
Examining which days and hours see the highest ride requests. 
Identifying factors that affect surge pricing.

Machine Learning: 
Predicting trip costs using features like distance, time, and duration. 
Determining high-demand hours or days based on historical data.

Reporting: 
Summarizing findings and visualizations in a comprehensive report.
Providing clear insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
